## This repository is a backup of the older BiblioPixel v2 for users that still require Python 2. We highly recommend using Python 3 and [BiblioPixel v3](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/BiblioPixel) instead.

#### For BiblioPixel v2 usage details, check the [v2 Wiki](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/BiblioPixel2/wiki)!
#### If you still need support, please post on the [Forum](http://forum.maniacallabs.com)

For easy hardware interfacing, check out the BiblioPixel supported [AllPixel](http://maniacallabs.com/AllPixel).

Overview
====

BiblioPixel is a pure Python 2 library for programming light animations. It provides an easy to use, cross-platform, and completely output agnostic framework that greatly eases designing and programming animations for a wide variety of displays.

In the current form, it is designed specifically for displays comprised of LED strips, but there are no real limits on what the output device can be, due to the output driver model.

See the documentation in the [Wiki](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/BiblioPixel/wiki) for more detailed information.
